# Security-Keypad-FSM
Developed a multi-stage security system featuring three hierarchical Finite State Machines (FSMs) to handle keypad input sequencing, lock timing, and an error-counting alarm module.
Designed and implemented a modular Digital Security Keypad System using Verilog HDL, centered around a hierarchical architecture of three synchronous Finite State Machines (FSMs) for input sequencing, timing control, and alarm management. The project involved a comprehensive hardware optimization phase where behavioral and structural modeling techniques were compared; by analyzing Gate Input Count (GIC) across D, T, and JK flip-flop implementations, the design was refined to achieve a 16% reduction in logic complexity. The final system features robust security protocols, including an error-count module that triggers a persistent alarm state after three failed attempts and integrated debouncing logic, all verified through extensive testbench simulations to ensure reliable performance under diverse edge-case scenarios.
